The quick review includes some paper related to detecting images generated by diffusion models. It is a new field that has few references.  

## Consideration
- generalization: use image generated by other architecture to detect  
- Some special feature (or forensics traces) may be removed when image quality is impaired in real world (Paper01)
- Frequecy analysing is important (Paper 00, 01 use this method)
- **DIRE** is a sloid baseline, and the experiments are complete.

## Paper 00 - Towards the Detection of Diffusion Model Deepfakes  

### contribution  
- Indicate that there is a structural difference between synthetic images generated by GANs and DM(diffusion model)s, and DM-generated images are harder to detect (GAN-generated image has specific patterns)  
- Detection by **frequecy** domain analysing: artifacts is not obvious in spectrum of DM-genrated images but is obvious in GAN-genrated images   
- Proposed a method for evaluating: **Pd@FAR**

### Consideration  
- From table.2, we can found that the performance existing detector trained in LSUN Bedroom dataset has potential to improve, especially in the big datasets like ImageNet. Pd@FAR is the use of
the **probability of detection** at a fixed **false alarm rate**.  
- How to evaluate the classifier, is Pd@FAR reasonable and is there a metric better than Pd@FAR?  
- can we propose an universal detection framework to detect both GANs and DMs generated images?  


## Paper 01 - On the detection of synthetic images generated by diffusion models  

### contribution  
- Partially prove that DMs-generated images also have distinctive fingerprints.  
- Prove that performance will drop a lot when the images are **compressed** (like jpeg compress)

### Consideration    
- The vanish of feature in compressed image is a good point to explore --> how to deal with it?
- cannot use a fixed threshold, Pd@FAR is better than it at least.
