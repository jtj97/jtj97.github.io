The quick review includes some paper related to detecting images generated by diffusion models. It is a new field that has few references.

## Dataset  
[GenImage: A Million-Scale Benchmark for Detecting AI-Generated Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08571) : images generated by GANs and diffusion models.

## Paper 00 - Towards the Detection of Diffusion Model Deepfakes  

### contribution
- Indicate that there is a structural difference between synthetic images generated by GANs and DM(diffusion model)s, and DM-generated images are harder to detect (GAN-generated image has specific patterns) 
- Detection by **frequecy** domain analysing: artifacts is not obvious in spectrum of DM-genrated images but is obvious in GAN-genrated images   

### Problems
- From table.2, we can found that the performance existing detector trained in LSUN Bedroom dataset has potential to improve, especially in the big datasets like ImageNet. Pd@FAR is the use of
the **probability of detection** at a fixed **false alarm rate**.
- How to evaluate the classifier, is Pd@FAR reasonable and is there a metric better than Pd@FAR?
- can we propose an universal detection framework to detect both GANs and DMs generated images?
