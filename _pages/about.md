I received a Bachelor degree from School of Electronic Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), China. Then I obtained a Master degree conferred by [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) from a Joint Master program with [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with Prof. [Qujiang Lei](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~lei_qujiang?language=en) and senior engineer [Weijun Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wwjexp?language=en)

My research interest was object detection. I participated several projects during my master's, including the detection of mask during the COVID-19, PCB defects inspection, Et al. I gained a lot of experience in programming and computer vision from these projects.
<!--Especially in the synthetic image detection field-->
Currently, I'm finding a Ph.D position in computer vision and related fields.
